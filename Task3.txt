1. I have learned a great deal here. I knew practically nothing about SDL and now I know how to draw filled geometric figures pretty efficiently.
I learned how to check if you clicked inside an object. I've learned how to properly render a game, etc.

2. The most difficult thing I faced in this lab was filling a circle. I looked up how to do it and found someone drawing a filled circle using points.
This took really long to draw, especially if the circle was large. Solved it by coming together with Magnus and Morgan and finding a formula to find two
points to use in drawing a line for every x coordinate instead of points.

3. I don't know.
